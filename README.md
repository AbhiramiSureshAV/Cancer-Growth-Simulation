# Cancer-Growth-Simulation

This project simulates the growth and spread of cancerous cells in a tissue using Python. The simulation visualizes the process and provides insights into how cancerous cells grow and spread over time.

# Features
Simulates cancer cell growth and spread in a circular tissue.
Visualizes cell states over time (Healthy vs Cancerous).
Tracks the number of healthy and cancerous cells at each time step.
